# ipfs-cluster changelog

### v0.3.2 - 2018-01-19

This release includes two important features:
  * Commands to export and import the internal cluster state: these allow to perform easy and human-readable dumps of the shared cluster state while offline, and eventually restore it in a different peer or cluster.
  * The introduction of `replication_factor_min` and `replication_factor_max` parameters for every Pin (along with the deprecation of `replication_factor`). The defaults are specified in the configuration. For more information on the usage and behavour of these new options, check the IPFS cluster guide.

* Features
  * New `ipfs-cluster-service state export/import/cleanup` commands | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#240](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/240) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#290](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/290)
  * New min/max replication factor control | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#277](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/277) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#292](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/292)
  * Improved migration code | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#283](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/283)
  * `ipfs-cluster-service version` output simplified (see below) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#274](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/274)
  * Testing improvements:
    * Added tests for Dockerfiles | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#200](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/200) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#282](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/282)
    * Enabled Jenkins testing and made it work | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#256](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/256) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#294](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/294)
  * Documentation improvements:
    * Guide contains more details on state upgrade procedures | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#270](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/270)
    * ipfs-cluster-ctl exit status are documented on the README | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#178](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/178)

* Bugfixes
  * Force cleanup after sharness tests | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#181](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/181) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#288](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/288)
  * Fix state version validation on start | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#293](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/293)
  * Wait until last index is applied before attempting snapshot on shutdown | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#275](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/275)
  * Snaps from master not pushed due to bad credentials

These release is compatible with previous versions of ipfs-cluster on the API level, with the exception of the `ipfs-cluster-service version` command, which returns `x.x.x-shortcommit` rather than `ipfs-cluster-service version 0.3.1`. The former output is still available as `ipfs-cluster-service --version`.

The `replication_factor` option is deprecated, but still supported and will serve as a shortcut to set both `replication_factor_min` and `replication_factor_max` to the same value. This affects the configuration file, the REST API and the `ipfs-cluster-ctl pin add` command.

### v0.3.1 - 2017-12-11

This release includes changes around the consensus state management, so that upgrades can be performed when the internal format changes. It also comes with several features and changes to support a live deployment and integration with IPFS pin-bot, including a REST API client for Go.

* Features
 * `ipfs-cluster-service state upgrade` | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#194](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/194)
 * `ipfs-cluster-test` Docker image runs with `ipfs:master` | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#155](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/155) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#259](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/259)
 * `ipfs-cluster` Docker image only runs `ipfs-cluster-service` (and not the ipfs daemon anymore) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#197](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/197) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#155](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/155) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#259](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/259)
 * Support for DNS multiaddresses for cluster peers | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#155](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/155) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#259](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/259)
 * Add configuration section and options for `pin_tracker` | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#155](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/155) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#259](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/259)
 * Add `local` flag to Status, Sync, Recover endpoints which allows to run this operations only in the peer receiving the request | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#155](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/155) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#259](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/259)
 * Add Pin names | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#249](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/249)
 * Add Peer names | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#250](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/250)
 * New REST API Client module `github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/api/rest/client` allows to integrate against cluster | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#260](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/260) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#263](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/263) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#266](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/266)
 * A few rounds addressing code quality issues | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#264](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/264)

This release should stay backwards compatible with the previous one. Nevertheless, some REST API endpoints take the `local` flag, and matching new Go public functions have been added (`RecoverAllLocal`, `SyncAllLocal`...).

### v0.3.0 - 2017-11-15

  * Fix configuration save | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#213](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/213) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#214](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/214)
  * Forward progress updates with IPFS-Proxy | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#224](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/224) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#231](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/231)
  * Delay ipfs connect swarms on boot and safeguard against panic condition | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#238](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/238)
  * Multiple minor fixes | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#236](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/236)
    * Avoid shutting down consensus in the middle of a commit
    * Return an ID containing current peers in PeerAdd
    * Do not shut down libp2p host in the middle of peer removal
    * Send cluster addresses to the new peer before adding it
    * Wait for configuration save on init
    * Fix error message when not enough allocations exist for a pin

This releases introduces some changes affecting the configuration file and some breaking changes affecting `go` and the REST APIs:

* The `consensus.raft` section of the configuration has new options but should be backwards compatible.
* The `Consensus` component interface has changed, `LogAddPeer` and `LogRmPeer` have been replaced by `AddPeer` and `RmPeer`. It additionally provides `Clean` and `Peers` methods. The `consensus/raft` implementation has been updated accordingly.
* The `api.ID` (used in REST API among others) object key `ClusterPeers` key is now a list of peer IDs, and not a list of multiaddresses as before. The object includes a new key `ClusterPeersAddresses` which includes the multiaddresses.
* Note that `--bootstrap` and `--leave` flags when calling `ipfs-cluster-service` will be stored permanently in the configuration (see [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#235](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/235)).

### v0.2.1 - 2017-10-26

This is a maintenance release with some important bugfixes.

* Fixes:
  * Dockerfile runs `ipfs-cluster-service` instead of `ctl` | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#194](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/194) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#196](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/196)
  * Peers and bootstrap entries in the configuration are ignored | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#203](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/203) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#204](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/204)
  * Informers do not work on 32-bit architectures | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#202](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/202) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#205](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/205)
  * Replication factor entry in the configuration is ignored | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#208](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/208) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#209](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/209)

The fix for 32-bit architectures has required a change in the `IPFSConnector` interface (`FreeSpace()` and `Reposize()` return `uint64` now). The current implementation by the `ipfshttp` module has changed accordingly.

  * Update Dockerfiles | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#154](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/154) | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#185](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/185)
  * `ipfs-cluster-service`: Do not run service with unknown subcommands | [ipfs/ipfs-cluster#186](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/186)

This release introduces some breaking changes affecting configuration files and `go` integrations:

* Config: The old configuration format is no longer valid and cluster will fail to start from it. Configuration file needs to be re-initialized with `ipfs-cluster-service init`.
* Go: The `restapi` component has been renamed to `rest` and some of its public methods have been renamed.
* Go: Initializers (`New<Component>(...)`) for most components have changed to accept a `Config` object. Some initializers have been removed.
